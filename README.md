This is my version of the popular Brick Breaker game, it's not made perfectly but it has lots of interesting features, mainly power ups and power downs. In the "Assets"
directory you can see a glimpse of what they do. They make it more interesting than just bouncing a ball off a platform and destroying bricks. Here
is the list of all of the power ups and downs: 
Dmg+ and dmg- mean respectively increased damage dealt by the ball and decreased. 
FastBall and SlowBall mean speed up and slow down of the ball. 
FastPlatform and SlowPlatform do the same as the above but with the platform. 
LongPlatform and ShortPlatform stretch or squish the platform.
ToughBrick increases the bricks max health.
ExtraBricks adds a lair of bricks.
BedrockBreaker allows you to destroy bedrock bricks (below is the description of bedrock bricks).
Fireball has the effect of "burning" when the ball hits a brick. It makes it take damage for some time after the hit. It minimally decreases damage dealt upon hit.
Superball makes the ball pass through all the bricks and bounces only off screen edges, dealing loads of damage. It's the most powerful and the rarest power up.

The bricks:
Basic - can be destroyed with one hit, without any power downs.
Shielded - has "2 lives". First you need to destroy the shield (4 hits with no power ups/downs) and then it turns into a very weak basic brick. Note, if you have the dmg+
upgrade catched multiple times (added effect) hitting this brick only eliminates the shield and you need to hit it again in order to destroy it.
Bombed - upon destruction deals massive damage to the bricks directly connected with it and the first ones that are positionned diagonally.
Bedrock - Unbreakable brick. It can be broken only using the BedrockBreaker upgrade.

To start the game you need to press enter while in the main menu. To launch the ball press Alt. If you lose, press Space to start a new game.
Press Esc anytime to close the window.
